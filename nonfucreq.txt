The app should load all features in under 2 % over 99% of the time on
all new currently sold devices from Apple, Samsung, and google. 
For network functions, it will be assumed that the user has a decent internet connection. 
This is to make sure the app is a pleasant experience for anyone. 
(In this case it would probebly be best to allow testing on
the slowest phone in this criterium)

The app should continue to work as described above, even as usage ramps up. 
The system should be able to hande 500.000 concurrent users. 
This can be done through performance tests of underlying infrastructure. 
Also this is to make sure the app is a pleasant experience for anyone. 

The app's services should be fully functional 99.5% of the times. 
This is important for those who depend on the app to stay active. 

All sent user data should be encrypted, and the app should comply with GDPR. Furthermore: 
Sensitive user data: user profiles, progress data, and payment information
should be stored encrypted. 
This is not just to maintain user trust, but also to eliviate possible legal issues. 

The codebase should be well-documented and tested
90% of functions need a simple documentation string. 
80% of functions need a unit test. 
90% of systems need integration tests. 
This is to improve overal reliability. 
(note, extensive documentation kind of goes against agile)

The app should allow for tracking (including GPS) for 7 hours from 100%
on any new, modern phone from Apple, Samsung, or Google. 
This is to ensure a worry-free experience for phones across the price spectrum
where it would be reasonable.
