As a novice user, I want the app to not have to many options, to make the app feel more 
inviting. 

When I start up the app, I do not feel overwhemed with options and I can easilly 
get where I need to go. 
-----------------------
**
As a novice user, I want the app to create personallised workouts for me depending on my 
day, level and goals, as to motivate me to keep active

In the app, I see a few suggestions for workouts on this day, depending on my level 
with several intensities to choose from. 
-----------------------
**
As a user, I wish for the app to include a way to share my workouts with friends
as to motivate myself and others. 

In the app, I see a "community" tab where I can see work-outs of my friends
Also, I can share my own workouts to others. 
-----------------------
**
As a user, I want the app to work with my existing equipment, including gym equipment 
(like threadmill), smartwatches and fitness band, to provide for more insightful 
data. 

In the app settings, I can pair supported devices. Their metrics then show up
in my workouts. 
-----------------------
**
As a user, I want the app to support pre-defined gradual workout plans, such as the 
"Couch to 5K program", to encourage gradual progress and manegable goals. 

I can select a pre-defined long-term program to follow from a menu. 
The app will then suggest the next work-out in line from my program. 
-----------------------
**%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As a user, I want the app to show me friendly, encouraging messages to 
further motivate me. 

After a work-out is over, an appropriate message is randomly shown. 
Similar messages appear in the progress log. 
-----------------------

**%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%
As a first-time user, I want the app to include an introduction sequence to 
request the relevant data, to personallise the app. 

When first starting the app, a screen pops up asking for you personal information
and preferences. It then gives a brief overview of the features of the app.
-----------------------
**
As a user, I wish for the app to allow me to set activity goals, to motivate me to 
consistently be active. 

In settings, the user finds an option to set a daily goal for active minutes. 
The home screen shows the goal clearly, as well as a percentage completed. 
This feature should also be integrated into the push notifications. 
-----------------------
**%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As a non-English speaking user, I want the app to be translated to my language, 
allowing me to use the app. 

The app should detect the phone's language and show everything in the correct language.
The user can override the language from the settings. 
-----------------------
**
As a user, I want the app to record elapsed time, distance, pace, and (if enabled)
GPS location, to gain further insight into my work-out, while running it and afterwards. 

When the user starts a work-out for a relevant activity (for example, not when
running on a threadmill), the app should show the location and taken path
in the current workout view. When the workout is saved, the taken path, 
including data at each point, should be revealed.

As a user, I want to export my achievements to external social media apps 
to share my progress with friends

When viewing a past workout, there is a share button. 
This allows the user to share an image with workout-info with their 
phone OS's share window. 
-----------------------

**
As a user, I want to pause the workout, and resume later to take a breather. 

In the currren workout view, there is a pause button. Pressing it pauses the workout. 
After this, the workout can be resumed or quit.

as a user, I want the app to make it clear every movement is a win,
so that even on days where I have little energy, I stay motivated to work out,
even if just a little bit.

when I am done with my workout, even if it wasn't a lot,
the app is positive about the fact that I worked out, through a message.
-------------------------
**
as a user, I want the app to track walks as well instead of only runs, 
so that I can still keep track of my progress/movement on days
 where I do not have enough energy to run.

while I'm on a walk, the app registers a lower speed and sees this as a walk and
not a run, and adjusts any feedback accordingly.
-------------------------
**
as a user, I want the app to allow me to keep a list of my existing fitness
equipment and use that to make plans for workout session, so that I use all my 
equipment, and do not get any workouts that require equipment I do not have 
access to.

after giving the app the information about what equipment I have available to me, 
it adjusted the workouts it suggests to that information
-------------------------
**
as a novice user, I want the app to prioritize simple metrics, so that I can more 
easily track my progress, without information I do not care about or know the 
significance of.

when looking up information about my run to see how I did, I see simple things 
like distance and speed first before metrics like heartrate
--------------------------
**
as a user, I want the app to have customizable goals, so that if I think a 
workout will be too much or take too long, I can lessen what I do in the workout.

when I have chosen what workout I wish to do for today, I get an option to lessen 
or leave out parts of the workout in case I do not have the energy or time to 
complete the full workout.
---------------------------
**
as a user, I want the app to keep a record of my progress (progress log), 
so that I can more easily see the long term progress that I am making through the
use of this app.

in the app, I can see a day by day record of what I have done, which can show a 
gradual increase in what I can handle.
