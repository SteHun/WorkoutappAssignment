You stated that the app should be developed in an agile way. 
You also requested extensive documentation. 
Agile requires developers to not write extensive documentation. 
Could you please clarify?
We will assume the app will use agile principles, except for the documentation. 

The main goal for the community features seems a little unclear. 
Is it supposed to create a public social media where people upload their
work-outs for everyone? If so, does it need some kind of 
recommendation algorithm? Or is it just for people you are friends with? 
We will assume the app only connects with those you befriended. 

It is requested to remain positive at all times. But what happens 
when the user stops training. Should it still show them positive messages?
Particularly the "progress menu" seems difficult. How do you
keep the positive messages while showing a downward graph? 
We will assume to keep to a positive tone whenever possible, and to
use a motivational tone when positive would seem sarcastic.
